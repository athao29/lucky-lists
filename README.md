For my final proect in LIS 640: Intro to Web Development, I have created a functional and interactive to-do list website called Lucky Lists. 
As users go through the website, they will encounter a numver of pages like a home page, libraries, and item creation.
The main page of this website is the new-item.html page where users are able to create, edit, delete, and reorganize task items they've created.
Since this is a front-end project that focuses on creating a to-do list there are some limitations to this project: 
  • users aren't able to create new lists for the library 
  • task items aren't able to save to lists as there is no back-end/database/library for them to be saved to
